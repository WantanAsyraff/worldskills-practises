# WorldSkills Practises 🖥️✨

This repository contains my practice exercises for **WorldSkills training**, focusing mainly on **frontend web development** with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**.  
Each folder represents either a **daily practice session** or a **small tutorial project** built to strengthen my coding fundamentals.

## 🗓️ Bulan 7 – Daily Practices
The **Bulan 7** folder contains exercises done on different dates in July 2025.  
Each date folder usually includes:
- `index.html` → the main HTML file  
- Supporting `.css` and `.js` files for styling and logic  

These are experimental practice files where I explored layout, styling, and interactivity.

These are **focused mini-projects** created to strengthen my understanding of jQuery:

- **Change Background Color** → Interactive button to toggle/change page background colors.
